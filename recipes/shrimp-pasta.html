    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Cook pasta in salted water according to package directions; drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until pink on both sides and just cooked through, turning once, about 2 minutes per side; transfer to a separate bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add sun-dried tomatoes, tomato spread, and garlic to the same skillet; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in flour and continue cooking, stirring constantly, 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Whisk in wine, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Bring to a simmer and cook, undisturbed, until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add broth, heavy cream, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and smoked paprika; whisk until fully combined. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened and just coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low; add cooked pasta and shrimp to skillet. Cook, stirring often, until evenly coated and heated through, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat; garnish with basil and serve immediately.</li>
